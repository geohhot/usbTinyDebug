USBTinyDebug
============

A debugging tool for **usbtinyisp**. The original project idea was from [cnlohr's](https://github.com/cnlohr) project called [tinyispterm](https://github.com/cnlohr/tinyispterm). But his project used linux's core's **USB** API, mine uses **LibUSB**.

Work in progress yet.
